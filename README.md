# printf project

This project is a C program that replicates the functionality of the printf function in the standard library. The printf function is used to format and print data to the standard output. The program can handle various conversion specifiers, such as %c, %s, %d, %i, %u, %x, %X, and %p. It also supports some flags, such as -, +, space, #, and 0, and some modifiers, such as h, hh, l, and ll.

The main file of the project is _printf.c, which contains the _printf function and some helper functions. The header file holberton.h contains the prototypes of the functions and the definition of a struct used to store the specifiers and their corresponding functions. The folder man_3_printf contains a manual page for the _printf function.

To use the program, you need to compile all the .c files in the project folder and link them with your main file. For example:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c main.c -o printf

Then you can run the program as follows:

./printf

The output will depend on the arguments passed to the _printf function in the main file. For example, if the main file contains this code:
